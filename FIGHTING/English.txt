Formula 1: racing car, car body, design, mechanical parts,
electronic components, engine speed.

Formula 1 is one of the most spectacular sports, where cars reach high
speeds. Not at least of all Formula owes this computers and electric
systems. Electronic components built into the racing car allow to track
indicators such as air pressure, air temperature, engine speed, driving
speed and much more. During racing they recieve information and send it
to team. Using all this data enginers can design car with more aerodynamic
car body. Also all recieved data provides to figure out how the racing
car will behave in different conditions and depend on they mechanics
will replace some mechanical parts to encrease driveability and speed.
